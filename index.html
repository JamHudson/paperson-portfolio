            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Paperson is a successful entrepreneur born and raised in Evanesce, Verisimil. 
                Charting a path through the unknown, dedicating attention to promising projects. 
                Most known for creating the now infamous C-Head Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paperson dreamt of writing a best-selling book series. 
                He's tried many times to write a killer novel, sometime skipping to the second and third book before going to publishers. 
                Unfortunately, no one saw the genius in his writing at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still <b>fueled</b> with <b>burning</b> passion, Paperson started working at a printing company owned by one of these book publishers. 
                A promotion landed him as manager of the janitorial team. 
                He made the executive decision to replace all fire-extinguishers with spray bottles, saving the company money. 
                Just days after this change, the building caught fire and burned to the ground. 
                Paperson was the sole survivor. 
                He credited his survival to the spray bottles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Families of the lost sued Paperson for "unsafe working conditions." 
                The accusations were baseless, and Paperson personally defended himself in court. 
                He counter-sued for an astounding $&gamma;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;.
            </p>
            <p>
                After accruing enough money to retire, Paperson set his sights on bigger projects than mere word-smithing.
                In 257&beta;, Paperson opened the C-Head Hotel. 
                The building was the largest ever built in Evanesce. 
                Both tourist attraction and residential space, Paperson profited greatly.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 273&gamma;, the pent-house was struck by 46 thunderbolts. 
                The floor was instantly vaporized and the rest of the building burnt to the ground due to a lack of spray-bottles.

            <h1>Real Story</h1>
            <p>
                <b>J. Paperson</b>, originally known as James McPaperson, was a real piece of paper.
                He was born in a 6th Grade classroom out of a notecard, I think.
                The moment I made him, I instantly became attached. 
                It's absurd to think but I genuinely loved this small, triangular piece of paper. 
                As you can probably guess, he died within minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my other classmates was <em>weird</em>. Simply, <em>weird</em>. 
                I was friends with one of his friends, and so we were friends. 
                When I showed McPaperson to him, he decided to take it out of my hands and eat it. 
                Thus, concluded the life of James McPaperson.
            </p>
            <p>
                I irrationally started crying over a piece of paper, and it affected me enough that I dedicated every future thing I did to him.
                It's a miracle I have the photo I do of him, because it's literally the <em>only</em> one. 
                I've since recovered emotionally, obviously, but that small triangle smiley guy had a large impact on my mindset at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event I create a company, its name will likely be along the lines of <i>McPaperson</i> or <i>Paperson</i>.

                <h2>C-Head Hotel</h2>
                <p>
                    Paperson's proudest accomplishment. 
                    Take note of how the surrounding buildings are not even half its size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's believed Paperson was hiding something in the hotel. 
                    One of the most interesting theories was that it contained a passage way to the clouds.
                    There's no evidence there was anything of the sort, and now that the hotel is gone, there never will be.

                <h2>Stack Of Books</h2>
                <p>
                    Paperson's overwhelming stack of denied books. 
                    After accruing his wealth, he turned his manuscripts into a massive pile of pages. 
                    When interviewed about it, Paperson stated it represented the importance of owning a filing cabinet.

                    The artpiece is currently appraised at millions.

                <h2>Himself?</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the trend of every millionaire, Paperson tried to remake himself. 
                    Unlike other millionaries though, Paperson succeeded. After all, he is just paper. 
                    Unfortunately for the mimic, the world could only handle one Paperson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Less than a minute after it was born, it was devoured. 
                    This is the only remaining photo of that Paperson.
